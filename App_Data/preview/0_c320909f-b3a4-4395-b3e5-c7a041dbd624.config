<p>Kauri dieback is the deadly kauri disease caused
by&nbsp;<em>Phytophthora agathidicida.</em> Following DNA studies,
this&nbsp;fungus-like disease was formally identified in 2008 as a
distinct and previously undescribed species of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytophthora"
target="_blank"><em>Phytophthora</em>.</a> Kauri dieback is
specific to New Zealand kauri and can kill trees of all ages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What does it do to kauri trees?</h3>

<p>Microscopic spores in the soil infect kauri roots and damage the
tissues that carry nutrients within the tree. Infected trees show a
range of symptoms including yellowing of foliage, loss of leaves,
canopy thinning, dead branches and lesions that bleed gum at the
base of the trunk.</p>

<p>Some infected trees can show canopy dieback and even be killed
without any gum showing on the trunks as kauri dieback also acts as
a severe root rot below ground.</p>

<p>Nearly all infected kauri die. In the past 10 years, kauri
dieback has killed thousands of kauri in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Scientists are currently working to find control tools for this
disease but there is no known treatment at this time.</p>

<p>Some of the <a
href="/media/6608/kauri%20under%20threat%20from%20phytophthora.pdf"
target="_blank">first research</a> undertaken looked at what
species might be affected by this disease and the impact on NZ
kauri. The photo below shows how kauri dieback can kill a kauri
sapling within three weeks (compared to other
controls).&nbsp;<br />

<h3>&nbsp;Kauri dieback life cycle</h3>

<h3><img src="~/media/20610/cycle_496x260.jpg"  width="496"  height="260" alt="life cycle"/></h3>

<p>Kauri dieback spores are produced in the following
steps:&nbsp;</p>

<h5>1.&nbsp; Oospores (resting spores) are introduced into an area
of kauri</h5>

<h5>2.&nbsp; Oospores germinate to form sporangia (a structure
which produces zoospores)</h5>

<h5>3.&nbsp; These zoospores are released during and immediately
after heavy rain</h5>

<h5>4.&nbsp; Zoospores (mobile spores) swim through soil-water to
kauri roots, attach to the root surface, germinate to produce
mycelia which&nbsp;infects the kauri&nbsp;root</h5>

<h5>5.&nbsp; The&nbsp;organism grows through the root system to
affect tissues at the base of the trunk (damaging tissues that
transport nutrients and water to canopy)</h5>

<h5>6.&nbsp; More sporangia are formed from areas of infected
root…..which release more zoospores during/after heavy rain</h5>

<h5>7.&nbsp; Oospores form within infected tree tissue and are
release into the soil as tissue decays</h5>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The oospores are&nbsp;like the 'seeds' of this disease, with a
hard outer shell they can sit dormant in soil for up to three years
or more.&nbsp; These spores live in soil and are spread with soil
movement.&nbsp; Dirty footwear, animals, equipment and vehicles are
responsible for the large scale spread of this disease - between
different areas of kauri.</p>

<p>The introduction of spores to an area of kauri can lead to a new
area of infection. We don't yet know what "inoculum load"/number of
spores are required for an infection to occur - however, as the
spores can reproduce/multiply once introduced to an area, a minute
amount of soil with a tiny amount of spores can result in a new
area of disease.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2011, Simon Randall, Auckland University completed his
Master's thesis on <a
href="/media/6605/fishing%20for%20phytophthora%20in%20the%20waitakere%20ranges.pdf">
stream based water detection of Phytophthora species</a>.&nbsp;
&nbsp;Simon assessed if current stream based detection methods
could be used to detect kauri dieback within a catchment.
Interestingly, PTA was not detected in any water catchments in the
Waitakere Ranges (where areas of high infection were known). This
does not mean that kauri dieback doesn't spread via water
catchments (we know this species produces water borne <img src="/media/33561/zoospore.png" width="275" height="232" alt="zoospore" style="float: left;"/>spores in the lab) just that we don't
have the right tools to detect it yet. Simon did detect a number of
other phytophthora species in the streams - which proves the
'spread pathway" (ie. high likelihood that kauri dieback also
spreads via streams) it seems that kauri dieback is just a little
trickier to pin down.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr Cheryl Krull (University of Auckland) successfully completed
her PhD "Feral Pigs In A Temperate Rainforest Ecosystem; <a
href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC1303/S00041/ecological-research-leads-to-call-to-control-feral-pigs.htm">
Ecological Impacts and Management</a>" in 2012. Part of Cheryl's
work looked to determine if <a
href="/media/21833/krull%20et%20al%202012.pdf">feral pigs were
spreading PTA spores</a> in kauri forests. This study detected 19
species of plant pathogens in the soil on pig trotters and snouts,
including a different <em>Phytophthora</em> species
(<em>Phytophthora cinnamomi</em>). However, no PTA was isolated
from the samples. This is thought to be due to the detection
methods used at the time (methods have since been improved). Cheryl
concluded that it is highly likely that kauri dieback is also
spread by feral pigs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Work is now underway by the programme to assess what risks
livestock/cattle present to spreading the disease across rural
kauri stands.&nbsp; We expect results from this study to be
finished later in 2013.</p>

<p>A study is underway by the Kauri Dieback Management Team
Planning &amp; Intellingence team (Dr Tony Beauchamp, Will Ngakuru
and John Beachman) investigating the historic pathways and spread
of kauri dieback in New Zealand. This study aims to determine if
kauri nursery, planting and silviculture that was undertaken form
1930s until the 1980s contributed to the spread of the
disease.&nbsp; To date several kauri plantations including those on
Great Barrier and Northland have been confirmed as being PTA
positive.&nbsp; This work involves interviewing scientists,
foresters, nurserymen and kaumatua who were involved in this work
to gain their knowledge of activities and projects which may have
unwittingly also introduced kauri dieback to these planted stands.
So far, this work indicates kauri dieback has potentially been in
NZ since the 1950s.</p>

Research Associate Monique Wheat is currently researching <a
href="/media/18596/where%20in%20the%20wood%20is%20pta.%20tree%20matters%20edition%2053%20%20vol%2014%20(1)%20%2011.pdf">
where PTA exists in an infected tree</a> (ie. how far up the trunk
and into the wood). This work will help answer if we can safely
harvest and recycle the wood of dead trees and how we can safely
dispose of dead and dying tree. &nbsp;&nbsp;Monique is taking
wood/bark/tree samples from infected trees at various affected
kauri stands and is being helped from a number of dedicated
volunteer arborists and tree climbers.&nbsp; Results from this work
should be completed by the end of&nbsp;the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Where did it come from?</h3>

<p>Spores of kauri dieback were first discovered along with sick
kauri on Great Barrier Island in the 1970's. &nbsp;Identification
methods at the time led to these samples being misclassified as a
morphologically similar species.</p>

<p>Kauri dieback was formally identified in April 2008. Its closest
known relative is a chestnut pathogen from Taiwan
(<span>Phytophthora katsurae</span>).</p>

<p>It's origin and time of arrival in New Zealand is still unknown,
but evidence suggests it was introduced from overseas. This
assumption is currently based on the narrow genetic variation found
in the disease population (indicating a relatively recent
introduction that hasn't had time to evolve variation) and the
preference for high soil temperatures which suggests a more
tropical origin.</p>

<h3>Is kauri dieback really a 'new disease to science'?</h3>

<p>Spores of kauri dieback were first discovered from the soil
underneath&nbsp;sick kauri and in soil near seemingly "healthy"
kauri on Great Barrier Island in the 1970's. &nbsp;Identification
methods at the time led to these samples being misclassified as a
morphologically similar species and known kauri associate
<span>Phytopthora hevae</span> considered to pose a low risk to
kauri.</p>

<p>Kauri dieback was formally identified by Landcare Research work
in April 2008 following reports of kauri tree death in the
Waitakere Ranges. Laboratory investigations found kauri can be very
susceptible to this disease, with seedlings dying within weeks of
infection.</p>

<p>So although kauri dieback has been in New Zealand for at least
40 years, it was not correctly identified as a 'new species to
science' or understood to threaten kauri ecosystems until 2008.</p>

<p>NB. Spores recovered from soil around healthy trees does not
necessarily indicate that those trees are not or will not be
affected by the disease. This may indicate a lag phase (period of
time between the introduction to an area of soil and the
activity/infection of the tree) or early infection at root
level.</p>

<p>There is a small chance, that a degree of tolerance or
resistance to the disease may also explain such findings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Where is it?</h3>

<p>Kauri dieback has been found in the <a
href="http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/parksfacilities/premierregionalparks/Pages/waitakereranges.aspx"
 target="_blank" title="waitakere-ranges">Waitakere Ranges Regional
Park</a>, on private land throughout the Auckland region, in the

 target="_blank">Waipoua Forest</a> in Northland, home of our most
iconic kauri - Tane Mahuta.</p>

<p>In March 2014, kauri dieback was also unfortunately found in
bush in the Coromandel Peninsula - work is underway to determine
the extent of this infection.</p>

<p>At this stage, the disease has not been detected in many areas
of Northland forest, the Hunua Ranges and Hauraki Gulf Islands
(excluding Great Barrier). It's imperative that we protect these
uninfected areas.</p>

<p><a href="/where-is-it">Download map to view locations.</a></p>

<p>A national surveillance programme is underway to determine the
distribution of kauri dieback in New Zealand. Knowing which forests
are still healthy and which are contaminated is critical to ground
management.&nbsp; As kauri dieback spores are microscopic and
invisible to the naked eye, our surveillance programme often
depends on reliable detection and diagnostic methods to confirm if
soil or plant samples are PTA positive.&nbsp; A collaborative
partnership between our programme and Landcare Research, Scion
Research and Plant &amp; Food Research have successfully developed
a standard method to bait PTA out of soil into pure culture and
then genetically sequence each isolate to confirm the identity of
each cultures as being PTA.&nbsp; Using the genetic sequences of
PTA, a direct DNA probe is also under development which may allow
for the faster detection in the field.</p>

<h3>What can I do to save our kauri forests?</h3>

<p>Without any treatment or control tools, the only way we can save
our kauri forests is to contain the disease in its current
locations and stop the spread into healthy areas</p>

<p><img src="~/media/21139/p1000213_375x500.jpg"  width="375"  height="500" alt="Ian cleaning"/></p>

<p>When you are around kauri:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure shoes, tyres and equipment are cleaned to remove all
visible soil and plant material before AND after visiting kauri
forest</li>

<li>Please use cleaning stations installed on major tracks: scrub
to&nbsp;remove all soil and spray with <a href="/{localLink:1872}"
title="Trigene disinfectant">disinfectant</a>.</li>

<li>Stay on the track and off kauri roots</li>

<li>Keep your dog on a leash at all times.</li>
</ul>

<p>We all can help - tourists, hunters, trappers, trampers,
runners, bikers, walkers. We all need to make it happen, rather
than hope 'someone else' will do it.</p>

<p>Management&nbsp;efforts are focused on limiting the spread
within diseased forests and protecting healthy kauri areas.</p>

<p>Signage and footwear cleaning stations are now installed at many
track entrances in kauri areas. They should be used when entering
AND leaving.<a href="/{localLink:1872}"
title="Trigene disinfectant">Trigene disinfectant</a> is supplied
at these cleaning stations for park visitors to use.</p>

<p>Trigene is a broad spectrum disinfectant which is non-toxic,
non-corrosive, biodegradable and environmentally friendly.&nbsp;To
effectively kill any kauri dieback spores on footwear, try to
remove as much soil as possible first then wait for 1 minute before
entering kauri areas</p>

<p>Signage has been erected in key sites</p>

<p><img src="/media/8147/kauri%20dieback%20sign.jpg" width="359" height="500" alt="Kauri Dieback sign"/></p>

<p>Wild animal control, particularly of pigs, is happening in some
areas.</p>

<p>Work is also going into improving tracks construction, drainage
and other made-made influences that will help reduce the spread of
the disease</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Will parks or reserves be closed?</h3>

<p>Boot cleaning stations with track upgrades and temporary
closures of tracks will effectively manage the spread of&nbsp;
kauri dieback&nbsp;in many cases.</p>

<p>However, the closure of parks or reserves is&nbsp;an option to
minimise the spread of this disease
via&nbsp;&nbsp;humans.&nbsp;Land managers&nbsp;will make this call
balancing recreational requirements,&nbsp;&nbsp;cultural values,
ecological values, disease status and&nbsp;&nbsp;available
resources.&nbsp;The programme endorses track closures as one
strategy in preventing the spread of the disease - particularly for
forests where kauri dieback has not been detected.</p>

<h4>Current and planned closures:</h4>

<p>Mataitai reserve has been closed by DOC from March 2012 to
protect the healthy kauri within the reserve. This closure will be
reviewed in 5 years. This is the first time a&nbsp;whole reserve
has been closed for the purpose of managing the risk of introducing
kauri dieback disease.</p>

<p>Auckland Council closed thefollowing tracks and partial tracks
in the Waitakere Ranges from 1<span>st</span> of July 2012. These
closures are to establish 'kauri protection zones' to protect the
sizeable areas of healthy kauri that remain in the <a
href="http://regionalparks.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/waitakereranges"
target="_blank">Waitakere&nbsp;Ranges</a> and will be reviewed
annually.</p>

<h3>Treatment and control tools</h3>

<p>Phosphite (aka phosphorous acid or phosphonic acid) has been
used successfully to manage a number of other phytophthora species
in the horticultural industry and in the Australian dieback
programme. Dr Ian Horner completed lab work on phosphite and kauri
dieback in early 2011 &nbsp;and clearly found that phosphite can
"act against and inhibit PTA" .</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cultures of Phytophthora taxon Agathis (PTA) grown for 8 days on
V8-agar media amended with various concentrations of phosphorous
acid. Numbers are phosphorous acid concentrations in mg/L. Black,
blue and red marks in plates indicate colony margins after 1, 4 and
7 days, respectively</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="/media/33707/agar plates.png" width="341" height="280" alt="agar plates"/></p>

<p>Field trials are now underway in Northland and Auckland forests
to monitor the effect on infected kauri and work out dosage rates.
This work is midway through a four year assessment (part of the
difficultly of trialling control tools is that kauri are slow
growing so results take time to gather).<br />
&nbsp;Phosphite works to boost the plants&nbsp;'immune system' to
help it tolerate the disease.....the spores themselves are not
eradicated and annual doses are probably required to keep the
effects&nbsp;of the disease at bay. Work so far suggests that
phosphite may be a promising short term&nbsp;control tool...a
possible method to protect&nbsp;some high risk or iconic trees
until a cure is found or long term treatment tool is
developed.<br />

<h3>Planning earthworks?</h3>

<p>Care should be taken if working around kauri. To&nbsp;prevent
the introduction of kauri dieback, make sure&nbsp;all machinery is
clean&nbsp;before it enters your property.</p>

<p>All footwear, tools and equipment should also be cleaned of all
soil before and after working in kauri areas.</p>

<p>Where possbile, machinery and vehicles should remain on site for
the duration of a job.</p>

<p>Trigene disinfectant can be used to further sterilise equipment
as an extra precaution. Call O800 NZ KAURI (695 2874) to request
trigene supply from your local council.</p>

<h3><span>The Creation Myth</span></h3>

<p><span>In the beginning, out of nothingness Ranginui (the sky
father) and Papatuanuku (the earth mother) were created.</span></p>

<p><span>Rangi and Papa clung together, trapping the children they
had made in a land of</span> darkness. The strongest child Tane
mahuta (the god of the forests and creator of the
forest&nbsp;creatures) pushed his parents apart to bring light to
the land and allow his children to flourish.</p>

<p><span>The Te Roroa iwi of Waipoua forest believe Tane's legs
were the giant trunks of kauri.</span></p>

<h3>Kauri giants</h3>

<p>The New Zealand kauri is the largest tree in the Agathis genus
and the only Agathis species native to New Zealand.</p>

<p>Many of the great kauri giants were felled by early pioneers for
their high quality timber. One of the largest kauri trees ever
recorded was 'Kairaru of Tutamoe' with an estimated diameter of
6.4m and a height of 65m. Unfortunately, Kairaru was destroyed in a
fire before 1900.</p>

<p>The largest kauri alive today is Tane Mahuta with a diameter of
4.6m and height of 52m. It is estimated to be between 1200 and 2000
years old.</p>

<h3>Cultural significance</h3>

<p>Kauri is considered a taonga species by many Māori: valued as a
connection to the spiritual beliefs and way of life of their
ancestors.</p>

<p>Kauri played an important role in many aspects of early Māori
culture: integrated in creation mythology, rituals, war, art and
everyday life. Some large trees were given names and revered as
chiefs of the forest. On special occasions, the giant trunks of
kauri were used to carve out large waka taua (sea/war canoes)</p>

<p>Kauri gum had many valuable functions. Gum was burned as an
insecticide in kumara plots, wrapped&nbsp;in flax to make torches
for night-fishing and used as a chewing gum (kapia). Kauri resin
was also&nbsp;burnt and mixed with fat to create the ink for moko
(facial tattooing) of rangatira.</p>

<p>By the 1800s, early European pioneers had developed a thriving
timber and gum industry based on&nbsp;kauri. Large areas of kauri
were felled for their timber, which was valued for its strength and
ability&nbsp;to withstand sea-water conditions (ideal for boat
masts and hulls).</p>

<p>Kauri gum was used in varnishes, paint, linoleum and to create
ornaments. Gum was largely collected from the ground, however some
was gathered by deliberately injuring or 'bleeding' trees.</p>

<h3><span>The kauri family</span></h3>

<p>The New Zealand kauri (Agathis australis) belongs to one of
the&nbsp;world's oldest family of conifers, the Araucariaceae
family.</p>

<p>The Araucariaceae family includes three groups (or genera):</p>

<p>1. Araucaria, which has 19 species, including Norfolk pine and
monkey puzzle.</p>

<p>2. Wollemia, with just one species the Wollemi pine from New
South Wales, Australia</p>

<p>3. Agathis, with 21 tree species, found in forests from
South-East Asia to the western Pacific. All the trees in the</p>

<p>Agathis genus are generally known today as kauri.</p>

<h3>Kauri forest</h3>

<p>The present distribution of kauri is restricted to warm northern
regions above the latitude of 38°S (north of
Kawhia-Hamilton-Tauranga).</p>

<p>The site, soil and temperature determine the type of forest that
naturally contains kauri.</p>

<p>There is no 'typical kauri forest': kauri can exist as solitary
trees in broad leaf dominant bush or as dense&nbsp;stands.</p>

<p>In a forest environment, mature kauri emerge above the canopy of
other native trees. The lower forest can contain a variety of tree
species including totara, tanekaha, taraire, tawa, miro and
rewarewa alongside juvenile kauri.</p>

<p>At the shrub level a range of plant species can be found
including tree ferns, nikau palms, lancewood, hangehange and
mingimingi. Kauri grass is commonly found covering the ground below
kauri.</p>

<p>Kauri growth requires high light levels but can tolerate low
soil nutrient levels. Consequently, kauri seedlings are often
suppressed under dense canopies of faster growing species in
fertile soils. As a result kauri are often restricted to less
fertile soils on ridges or establish en masse after a large
disturbance such as a fire.</p>

<p>A range of orchids and epiphytic plants are also often found
perching amongst the branches of mature trees.</p>

<p>Kauri Dieback Symposium 30th November 2013<br />
Dr Bruce Burns, University of Auckland<br />
 Kauri (Agathis australis) is an endemic New Zealand conifer
confined to forests of northern North Island which is currently
threatened by dieback caused by Phytophthora 'taxon Agathis'. An
informed response to this dieback demands consideration of the
importance of kauri across ecological, economic, cultural and
social spheres. Kauri is the sole native representative of the
Araucariaceae in New Zealand with other members of this ancient
lineage mostly subtropical. It has a number of unusual biological
characteristics, e.g. capacity to grow to great size, age, and
biomass, and sluggishly decomposing litter which massively
accumulates on the forest floor. These characteristics allow kauri
to strongly influence the ecosystems in which it occurs and to act
as a selective agent for the biotic communities that develop around
it. This suggests that loss of kauri through kauri dieback will
result in major re-assortments of species distributions within
northern forests, leading to major losses of forest diversity at
local and landscape scales, and the probable complete loss of a
range of species highly dependent on kauri to provide habitat.
&nbsp;Kauri has also been an important forestry species in the past
and the historic exploitation of kauri forests and gum were
keystone economic activities for colonial New Zealand.
&nbsp;Currently, kauri's economic contribution is largely linked to
tourism and mining of a finite store of buried wood, but
consideration of its silvicultural properties indicates huge
potential for a future timber resource if replanted. Socially and
culturally, kauri is a flagship species for northern New Zealand,
with people identifying the presence of kauri with their sense of
place and cultural identity. These considerations indicate kauri
has enormous importance to New Zealand and provides ample
justification for efforts to prevent or reduce losses due to kauri
dieback.</p>

 Kauri dieback caused by Phytophthora 'taxon Agathis' (PTA), has
been prioritised as an emerging biosecurity threat to kauri
(Agathis australis) and the kauri forest ecosystem of northern New
Zealand. PTA is a water and soilborne pathogen that infects kauri
through its roots. &nbsp;Post-infection symptoms of kauri dieback
include; root rot, a collar rot resulting in large basal trunk
lesions, canopy defoliation and death. All size and age classes of
kauri have been confirmed as being susceptible to infection and
death. In 2008, PTA was declared an unwanted organism and a
national kauri dieback management programme was initiated.
&nbsp;Standardised survey methods were developed to undertake
national surveillance of prioritised forests to determine the
distribution of PTA in New Zealand. Survey sites were prioritised
to kauri areas with; high conservation value; containing culturally
significant or iconic trees, or representing the natural geographic
range of kauri. &nbsp;A risk assessment to determine current
vectors and potential historic pathways of disease spread led to
surveys and sampling also being undertaken in rural fragments
containing remnant kauri, historic kauri plantations and nurseries,
and at sites of high soil disturbance. &nbsp; Detection of PTA from
soil and tissue was achieved by the development of specific baiting
and isolation methods. &nbsp;Both aerial and ground based surveys
were undertaken to locate symptomatic trees as was a passive
surveillance programme whereby the public reported symptomatic
trees for inspection and diagnosis. &nbsp;A management programme to
contain disease spread and protect healthy kauri has also been
implemented across kauri land.</p>

 Phytophtora Taxon Agathis kills Kauri seedlings and trees of all
ages and is present in many of the remaining Kauri stands
throughout Auckland and Northland. Kauri trees are known to have a
considerable effect on soil and ecosystem properties. The loss of
Kauri trees could therefore lead to changes in ecosystem processes
such as carbon and water cycling. Since March 2013, we have
measured tree growth, litter fall (i.e. leaves, twigs, etc),
throughfall (i.e. rainfall which falls to the forest floor from the
canopy) and soil characteristics in the vicinity of minimally and
medium/highly infected Kauri trees in the Waitakere Ranges. The
minimally infected trees had slightly higher growth rates. We found
less litter under medium/highly infected trees compared to
minimally infected trees. Besides litter quantity the litter
composition changed. A higher proportion of angiosperm litter was
measured underneath medium/highly infected Kauri trees. Differences
were also found in the amount of rainfall reaching the forest
floor. More rainfall fell to the forest floor underneath
medium/highly infected trees. The amount and composition of the
litter will influence decomposition rates and thus the amount of
carbon released back into the atmosphere. An understanding of the
consequences of kauri dieback on ecosystem processes is crucial to
improve our understanding of pathogen related disturbances and to
make informed future management decisions.</p>

 Kauri Agathis australis, is threatened by an introduced, root- and
collar-rot pathogen, Phytophthora 'taxon Agathis' (PTA). This
soil-borne, homothallic species parasitises the roots, and cork
cambium, resulting in gummy lesions at the "collar", yellowing and
thinning of canopy-foliage, and tree-death. PTA is detected in soil
using an indirect, bioassay of the soil and plating to selective
medium. Managing the spread of this pathogen requires reliable
detection in soil and knowledge of how it spreads and survives.
DNA-based assays have been investigated and a real-time, PCR assay,
specific for PTA, has been developed. To help understand the
biology of this invasive Phytophthora species, the taxonomic
relationship of PTA to other closely related Phytophthora species
(i.e. P. castaneae and P. heveae) and its possible geographic
origins are also being investigated.</p>

 Kauri dieback, caused by Phytophthora taxon Agathis (PTA) is a
serious threat to the health and survival of kauri trees in New
Zealand. Phosphite (phosphorous acid) has been used successfully
against a number of Phytophthora diseases in horticultural and
forest settings; it is a potential tool for controlling PTA. In
January 2012, trials were established in Auckland (Huia and
Whatipu) and Northland (Raetea and Omahuta) kauri forests. Chemjet®
stem injectors were used to inject trees with phosphite
(Agrifos®600) at concentrations of either 7.5% or 20%, while
control trees were left untreated. Phytotoxicity symptoms were
noticed with the high application rate. After one year (January
2013), half of the previously injected trees were re-injected, in
all cases with 7.5% phosphite. In assessments made 17 months after
the initial treatment, most trial trees had canopy health and
vigour similar to or slightly worse than that at the start, with no
obvious differences between treatments. However, treatment
differences were obvious in trunk lesion assessments. &nbsp;Many
more lesions remained active (expressing ooze, continued expansion)
in untreated trees (53%) than in phosphite treated trees (2%).
There were no obvious differences in lesion activity among the
different phosphite rates or regimes. Many unanswered questions
about phosphite treatment remain, including; doses for large trees,
longevity of effect, curative ability on badly diseased trees,
unwanted side effects etc. Forest trials are continuing and will be
monitored every six months for a number of years, to determine both
the long-term effectiveness of phosphite treatments in kauri and
the necessity of repeat treatments.</p>

 Phytophthora cinnamomi is an introduced soil-borne plant pathogen
to Australia and together with a number of other Phytophthora
species has caused and is causing a devastating impact on many
plant species and communities. The flow on impacts to ecosystem
function and health are still poorly understood. &nbsp;Phytophthora
cinnamomi is now widespread in the majority of high rainfall areas
throughout Australia and considerable effort is being made to map
its distribution and determine species susceptibility. In Western
Australia, due to dwindling resources, emphasis is now being placed
on prioritizing areas that are protectable from the spread of
Phytophthora dieback for at least the next 50-100 years.
Protectable areas are based on threatened species and ecological
communities that are large enough and in areas that can be
adequately managed to prevent the likely risk of incursions. This
talk will briefly cover the impact of P. cinnamomi on plant species
and highlight the need to also include the other Phytophthora
species that are being increasingly found associated with dead and
dying plant species in managed and natural ecosystems. It will
discuss approaches to select priority areas for protection and the
management options being taken to reduce the spread and impact of
Phytophthora dieback.</p>

 The public communication of environmental issues presents
significant challenges, as these issues are typically complex. This
complexity arises from the unpredictable, uncertain and sometimes
contentious nature of the issue, which is unable to be solved using
a deterministic cause and effect approach to scientific
investigation. Furthermore, the complexity is further enhanced by
the number of stakeholders affected by the issue, with varied
levels of awareness and often with divergent perspectives on the
issue's importance, relevance and how it should be addressed. In
this environment, science needs to positively contribute to
solutions. This presentation positions kauri dieback as a complex
problem and draws on the literature and the authors' own research
to suggest ways to successfully communicate this complex issue. It
argues that agencies engaging in public campaigns involving complex
environmental issues, must utilize a combination of one and two-way
interactive approaches to communication. Doing this enables
stakeholders affected by environmental management actions, to be
both informed and actively engaged in a campaign and not just
subjects of persuasive messages.</p>

<p class="Default">Hi, my name is Ian Mitchell, I am of Maori,
Irish, Welsh and English descent. My Maori blood line centres at
Lake Omapere and extends to Kerikeri Inlet and Hokianga.&nbsp; I
have just been employed by MAF Biosecurity for the Kauri Dieback
Programme as the new Relationship Manager. The role is to manage
the Engagement and Behaviour Change team within the Programme. My
role is partly Liaison and partly Community Engagement, and all
about communication.</p>

<p class="Default">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Default">In terms of Liaison: within the Kauri Dieback
Programme are a number of 'Partners'. The Partners are the agencies
that jointly contribute to the Programme, and include Tangata
Whenua Roopu (where all hapu and iwi affected by the Kauri Dieback
Disease are represented), MAF Biosecurity, Dept of Conservation,
Northland Regional Council, Auckland Council, Waikato and BOP
Regional Councils.</p>

<p class="Default">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Default">Within the Programme there are a number of lines
of research being undertaken, as we have a lot to learn about the
disease, mainly around where the disease is located, what controls
are effective and how we can manage Kauri Forests to minimise the
impact and spread of the disease.&nbsp; We need to weave in our
indigenous cultural knowledge with our scientific knowledge to be
as effective as we can be to halt this disease.</p>

<p class="Default">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Default">It is imperative therefore that there is good,
open, continual, consistent communication between the partners. In
my liaison role I hope to be effective at sharing both the cultural
and the scientific knowledge, so all parties can be up with the
play, consistent, and effective.</p>

<p class="Default">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Default">In terms of Community Engagement: Ultimately,
the Kauri Dieback Programme has to get out there and connect with
the community. We need to make the community aware of the extent of
the problem and to work out with the community what are the best
approaches to solving the problem. We need to be effective in
building up an awareness of this disease within our Forest-User

<p>At the kauri dieback stand, children were invited to view the
spores of kauri dieback through a microscope. This was the first
community event where the microscope has been trialed and was a
great success. Spores that are invisible to the naked eye were
magnified by 400 times - the fact that such tiny organisms can kill
our biggest trees really hit home with the visitors to the
stand.</p>

<p>Look out for microscopes at our stands in the future.</p>

<p>The event was a great success with eighty 4-wheel-drive vehicles
and 270 participants raising over $6000 for the school.</p>

<p>The event ran through paddocks on private farm land and along
roads through native bush in Auckland council park land. &nbsp;The
Hunua ranges are one of the few large areas of kauri with no kauri
dieback in the Auckland region so strict cleaning procedures were
put in place for this event. 4WD vehicles and machinery can easily
move soil between areas of kauri and may spread kauri dieback
disease if care is not taken. All vehicles arrived clean for this
event and were sprayed with trigene disinfectant as a further
precaution.</p>

<p>The spray unit developed for this purpose may be further

This day has really shown that with a little care and effort we can
still enjoy kauri forest without putting the trees at risk.</p>

<p>With over 2350 species to choose from, New Zealander's picked
Kauri as our second favourite native plant this year. The Bamboo
Rush was elected the winner, providing awareness for this declining
species and it's shrinking wetland habitat.</p>

<p>Both Kauri and Bamboo Rush received several hundred votes: the
giant of the forest was pipped at the pose with Bamboo rush
receiving approximately 10% more votes than kauri.</p>

<p>The top three plant species:<br />
1. Bamboo Rush (Sporadanthus ferrugineus)<br />
2. Kauri (Agathis australis)<br />
3. NZ calceolaria (Jovellana sinclairii)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The reasons people voted for kauri included the following
examples:</p>

<p>"Like an old grandfather clock that in some odd way seems to be
older than time itself the kauri is ancient and majestic" -
Alistair</p>

<p>"Kauri is an extreme plant. It can grow extremely big, extremely
old and is extremely beautiful. It also has extreme effects on its
environment that allows a suite of allied and unusual species to
grow with it" - Bruce</p>

<p>"The majestic presence of Tane Mahuta in the Waipoua Forest is
an iconic image for Northland and NZ, standing for over 2,000 years
and watching over our growth. I like that Kauri change over time,
growing shoulder to shoulder with others for the first 20 years of
its life, then begins to change and stand out from the crowd." -
Sue</p>

<p>"Its majesty, its place in the forest community, its beauty and
its mana make it stand head and shoulders above the rest (no pun
intended!). Plus we need to amp up the PR around this tree to help
save it from evil PTA!" - Rachel</p>

<p>The plight against kauri dieback was common amongst the motives
for voting for kauri.</p>

<p>This work will involve a fixed wing light aircraft (Cessna)
flying back and forth over these islands for a total of six to
eight hours over one to two days. This is a pilot study for aerial
surveillance as a detection method for the presence of kauri
dieback disease. Kauri dieback is killing our native kauri in many
areas of New Zealand forest. This work should help establish how
wide-spread the disease is within Great Barrier Island /Aotea.</p>

              <data alias="bodyText"><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;Five bus shelters around Auckland, ranging from Albany to
Mangere and out to West Auckland have been adorned with the Save
Our Kauri Forest posters to raise awareness about the disease,
which is killing kauri trees in Auckland and Northland.</p>

<p><br />
"Using bus shelter ads is a great way to spread the word to the
general public who may not visit forest very often, but are still a
very important audience," says Stacey Hill, Kauri Dieback Liaison
Officer at Auckland Council.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Any movement of soil can spread this disease.&nbsp; Anyone
visiting or working in kauri forest should clean their shoes and
equipment before and after going," says Stacey.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is the only way to keep the disease contained."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is also the only way we can save healthy areas like the
Hunua Ranges, which are incredibly important, as no disease has
been found there yet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If this ad grabs someone's attention enough that they remember
on their next walk out in kauri forest or simply visit the website,
it is well worth it."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The eye-catching posters feature a tall, healthy kauri next to a
tree with bare branches - a victim of the fungus-like disease,
which can affect anything from a young sapling to an ancient
giant.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bus shelters are in Great North Road in Avondale, Godley
Road in Green Bay, East Coast Road in Northcross, Albany Hghway and
Massey Road in Mangere East from 29th July til the 26th August.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"This disease is spread by soil movement so could be
brought into Hunua on visitors' dirty shoes and equipment," says
Ali Thompson, Senior Ranger Conservation for Southern Parks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"Everyone working in or visiting kauri forest should make
sure their footwear and equipment including bikes is clean of soil
when they arrive and clean it again when they leave.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"It doesn't take much effort to do this and it is the only
way we are going to protect the kauri in Hunua from this
disease."</p>

<p>&nbsp;Visitors to parks and reserves should also always keep to
the tracks.</p>

<p>After a public call to the kauri dieback hotline, the council's
biosecurity team&nbsp; visited Woodstock school to check the two
trees, which were planted at the school about 30-40 years ago.
Although the canopies seem healthy, the bleeding at the base of the
trees is deemed "suspicious". Sampling and laboratory testing will
be undertaken within the next few weeks. In the meantime, the trees
have been cordoned off from foot traffic and signs installed at the
site.</p>

<p>If lab testing does detect kauri dieback, this will be the first
case of the disease in the Waikato region.</p>

<p>The theme of this year's Storyfest event in Kelston, West
Auckland was 'home is where the heart is' and celebrating what we
have in our homeland and backyards.</p>

<p>This was the perfect theme for the kauri dieback project, with
kauri being treasures of our backyards, whether that happens to be
your local park or on your own land.</p>

<p>The kauri dieback stand had a steady flow of visitors during the
day and had brochures, fact sheets and care guides available as
well as a display of photos, maps and posters to spread the
word.</p>

<p>This year there was also an activity table with colouring
sheets, game sheets and a make your own badge activity where
creative kids personalised the Keep Kauri Standing logo and had it
made into a badge.</p>

<p>Storyfest is an annual event aimed at young people and is part
of the Going West festival in West Auckland.</p>

<p>When 300 runners from five countries line up on Saturday for the
Coromandel's Great Cranleigh Kauri Run, they'll be meeting more
than just personal goals. Their very presence on the 32km trail
across the Coromandel Peninsula's Central Divide will leave a
positive impact on the regions famous forests. For every competitor
who lines up, this event quite literally plants a new kauri
tree.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In nine years this unique event has planted almost 2500 Kauri
seedlings. This weekend the kauri population will increase by 300
more entrants and trees.</p>

<p class="Pa1">We're delighted to welcome Coopers Creek Vineyard
into the whānau. This distinguished, family-owned company is based
close to the Waitakere Ranges and has been well aware of the kauri
dieback problem in recent times. Motivated to help make a
difference, they have offered the programme an innovative
partnership to spread the word.</p>

<p class="Pa1">&nbsp;<img src="~/media/22864/front label_300x284.jpg"  width="300"  height="284" alt="front label" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p>

<p class="Pa1">Their Lone Kauri brand (how apt !!) will carry the
programme message on its label and our promotional material will
feature at tastings and point of sale locations all around the
upper North Island. Lone Kauri wine is also exported to Asia, which
will help get us to our tourist market as well. Their sales
representatives have been briefed on the disease and the programme
but will point the public to the Keep Kauri Standing website for
up-to-date information. We'll also be featuring on their website
and updates will be posted in their Facebook and Twitter
conversations. The vineyard hosts Sunday Jazz events during summer
weekends with close to 300 people attending each time. All of these
visitors will get the chance to see Kauri Korner, a dedicated
display area in the vineyard tasting rooms, as well as promotional
material outside close to the action.</p>

<p class="Pa1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="Pa1">Relationship Manager, Ian Mitchell says, "Coopers
Creek approached Stacey Hill at Auckland Council some time ago with
this exciting opportunity to broaden our reach into communities. We
were very mindful of being associated with an alcohol product, but
after many discussions with Coopers Creek we were convinced they
are a very passionate and responsible organisation. Wine is about
moderate consumption and about good times with good friends. It's
about conversations and connecting with people. We see this
environment as perfect for raising awareness and understanding of
kauri dieback."</p>

<p>Cheers Lone Kauri!</p>

<p>Work is underway to raise awareness of kauri dieback disease in
the Waikato and Coromandel, in the hope that this disease can be
kept out of these regions.</p>

<p>The Waikato Regional Council have just produced a <a
href="/media/24534/media release.pdf" target="_blank">media
release</a>, so look out for articles in newspapers down that
way.<br />
<br />
The <a href="http://www.kauri2000.co.nz" target="_blank">Kauri 2000
Trust</a> have also worked with us to make a radio advertisement
which will be played in the region this summer. Listen to the ad <a
href="/media/24564/kauri_30_dec_153014.mp3"
target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
<br />
Great work to spread the word - but we need your help to keep the
Waikato and Coromandel regions disease free. Please remember to
clean your boots before visiting kauri forests and tell your
friends about this issue.<br />
Together we can protect these trees!</p>

<p>"New Zealand faces a number of important challenges and
opportunities.</p>

<p>Many of these are complex issues that require new knowledge
obtained through science and research.&nbsp;The Government has
launched the National Science Challenges (the Challenges) to
provide a means to address the most pressing of these complex
issues.</p>

<p>The Challenges will seek answers to questions of national
significance to New Zealand by focusing effort and providing
additional focus on key areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Challenges provide an opportunity to identify which issues
are most important to New Zealand and will allow Government to take
a targeted, cross-government approach to addressing them.</p>

<p>Areas potentially covered under the Challenges model include:
food, agriculture, environment, marine, biosecurity, energy and
hazards, health, society, and economic growth.</p>

<p>The 2012 Budget set aside $60 million over four years for the
National Science Challenges."</p>

in soil collected from the snouts and trotters of pigs, other

<p>The 14th Mangawhai Walking Weekend offers over 30 guided walks
around the beautiful&nbsp;Mangawhai area. This well organised event
explores natural areas on private and public land, hosting hundreds
of people with the support&nbsp;of over 80 volunteer guides. Walks
range from the beach to caves to lush forests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organisers&nbsp;do a great job providing information about kauri
dieback and ensuring all participants clean footwear ('clean in,
clean out') to &nbsp;prevent the spread of the disease in the area.
Brilliant way to spread the word while protecting healthy areas up
there!</p>

<p>With a food and wine festival on the Saturday and an art trail
to explore - this event really does have it all!</p>

<p>Dr Ian Horner completed lab work on phosphite and kauri dieback
in early 2011&nbsp; and clearly found that phosphite can "act
against and inhibit PTA" .</p>

<h5>Cultures of Phytophthora taxon Agathis (PTA) grown for 8 days
on V8-agar media amended with various concentrations of phosphorous
acid. Numbers are phosphorous acid concentrations in mg/L. Black,
blue and red marks in plates indicate colony margins after 1, 4 and
7 days, respectively</h5>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Field trials are now underway in Northland and Auckland
forests to monitor the effect on infected kauri and work out dosage
rates. This work is midway through a four year assessment (part of
the difficultly of trialling control tools is that kauri are slow
growing so results take time to gather).<br />
&nbsp;Phosphite works to boost the plants&nbsp;'immune system' to
help it tolerate the disease.....the spores themselves are not
eradicated and annual doses are probably required to keep the
effects&nbsp;of the disease at bay. Work so far suggests that
phosphite may be a promising short term&nbsp;control tool...a
possible method to protect&nbsp;some high risk or iconic trees
until a cure is found or long term treatment tool is
developed.<br />

              <data alias="IntroText"><![CDATA[Auckland Conversations is a series of speaker events organised by the Auckland Council, where leading experts in a variety of fields present on topics that relate to Auckland becoming 'the world's most liveable city'. The most recent of these events was held on Tuesday August 6th at the Auckland Museum and focussed on the current plight of our great taonga, the New Zealand kauri (Agathis australis).

<p>Kauri trees, regarded as the kings of the forest, are a national
icon for New Zealand. But, without action to control the spread of
kauri dieback disease, we risk losing them forever. This ancient
species is so culturally, economically and ecologically important
that the impact of its loss would be devastating. While much
research has established insight into the biology and ecology of
kauri dieback, a cure is yet to be found which means that the
pressure to halt the spread of this fungus-like disease is well and
truly 'on'!&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the topic sitting close to the heart of many New
Zealanders, it came as no surprise to see the venue's auditorium
filled to such a degree that late-comers were seen perching on
stairs or hovering at the back! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Tasked with inspiring an audience of both scientists and general
kauri enthusiasts, six guest speakers enlightened the evening with
presentations on key aspects on the value of kauri trees, ranging
from their intrinsic cultural value and extensive historical
exploitation, to their modern ecological significance as a keystone
species upon which the survival of many other native plants is
dependent.</p>

<p><img src="/media/32476/giles_hardy.jpg" width="125" height="162" alt="giles_hardy" style="float: left;"/>Professor Giles Hardy
of Murdoch University, Western Australia, completed the evening
with insights into the merits of phosphite as an essential tool in
the fight against kauri dieback disease, and one which has been
trialled in New Zealand with a certain degree of success. Bringing
with him a wealth of experience in researching and combating
against other dieback pathogens in Australian forests, Professor
Hardy firmly urged deeper exploration into the use of this tool in
New Zealand, citing great success in Australia with phosphite
injections, trunk sprays and capsulated powder implants, which
essentially provides the tree with a 'vitamin-like immunity boost'
and can last between 6-8 years. In fact, so passionate are our
neighbours across the ditch about saving their own forest giants,
that community efforts involve 'injection days', whereby volunteer
groups make their way across many hectares of forest administering
'phosphite jabs' to both symptomatic and asymptomatic
trees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Professor Hardy's talk not only provided some much needed
optimism, but also served to provoke some healthy trans-tasman
competition, with his kiwi audience resolving to not be outdone by
either this devastating disease or their Australian
counterparts!</p>

<p>The paper summarises the results of Auckland Council's passive
surveillance programme (2008-March 2013) to assist private
landowners and community report sick trees and receive diagnostic
testing and management advice.&nbsp; The diagnostic and research
undertaken was in collaboration with Plant &amp; Food Research and
clearly demonstrated kauri dieback is serious and widespread
problem for Auckland landowners.&nbsp; Management implications
included&nbsp; containing the disease, protection healthy stands,
significant cost implications for removing dead trees and the
urgent need for control tools.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Collaborators Dr Ian Horner and Ellena Hough (Plant &amp; Food
Research) also published their results to date summarising the
increasing potential of using phosphite as management tool against
kauri dieback.</p>

This resource is designed for teachers and students of levels one
to five. The activities are designed to create awareness and extend
understanding of the threat to kauri trees from kauri dieback
disease, the loss we face if kauri became extinct, and what we can
do to protect kauri.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The Kauri Dieback Schools
Resource&nbsp;contains background information and provides
activities for use both inside and outside of the classroom with
links to the New Zealand curriculum.</p>

<p>New Zealanders are a pretty proud bunch, which should come as no
surprise given we've got a lot to be proud of!&nbsp; This rings
particularly true when it comes to our love of the outdoors and the
emphasis we place on the preservation of our unique forest
biodiversity. What many don't realise is the extent to which this
pride in our natural heritage influences newcomers to our country
and becomes an inter-cultural commonality within the melting pot of
New Zealanders.</p>

<p>For artist Weilun Ha, a second generation kiwi and proud
'Westie', a simple bush walk with friends two years ago proved a
pivotal and inspirational occasion. It was during this walk that
Weilun first came across a kauri dieback boot-cleaning station,
learned of the disease, the impact it has on kauri forest
ecosystems, and resolved to incorporate his love of the natural
world with his passion for art.</p>

<p>Subsequently he created his first gallery supported exhibition
entitled 'Gods of the Forest' which promotes advocacy for kauri and
the devastating kauri dieback disease.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under the tutorship of a Lingnan master of traditional Chinese
painting and the support of Lopdell House Gallery, Weilun developed
his unique style. By combining the Lingnan philosophy of 'balancing
the Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern' with his own dash of
'kiwiana' flair, Wei sees his work as a vehicle to translate and
communicate deeper issues across cultures. The result of this union
is an architectural corridor of painted panels, which in Weilun's
words "capture a story through time and space" and feature
life-like representations of native bush in both its glory and
demise. This story is portrayed via dominant black and white panels
which he uses to represent the past and the future, and contrasted
against a selection of coloured panels representing the current
situation of kauri. Bleeding gum and defoliated branches cast a
grim image against flitting fantails and cruisy keruru, to show
both destruction and hope for a brighter future for kauri and
native biodiversity.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, Weilun's desire to communicate other
important conservation plights through his art doesn't stop here,
citing issues such as shark-finning, snapper quotas and paua
poaching as close to his heart and next on the agenda!</p>

<p>A national surveillance programme is underway to determine the
distribution of kauri dieback in New Zealand. Knowing which forests
are still healthy and which are contaminated is critical to ground
management.&nbsp; As kauri dieback spores are microscopic and
invisible to the naked eye, our surveillance programme often
depends on reliable detection and diagnostic methods to confirm if
soil or plant samples are PTA positive.&nbsp; A collaborative
partnership between our programme and Landcare Research, Scion
Research and Plant &amp; Food Research have successfully developed
a standard method to bait PTA out of soil into pure culture and
then genetically sequence each isolate to confirm the identity of
each cultures as being PTA.&nbsp; Using the genetic sequences of
PTA, a direct DNA probe is also under development which may allow
for the faster detection of PTA in the field.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The second major soil testing programme around kauri tree sites
was recently concluded &nbsp;in Northland, Auckland, Waikato and
Bay of Plenty. Sites being tested included areas in significant
kauri stands and iconic trees.</p>

<p>The Programme acknowledges that time pressure to get fieldwork
underway meant involvement of Tangata Whenua was compromised&nbsp;
- both for tendering for participation in fieldwork and for
providing liaison follow up with mana whenua and site land

<p>Colin McCahon (1919-1987) is one New Zealand's most famous
painters. From 1953 to 1959 he lived with his family in French Bay,
Titirangi, in the Waitākere Ranges. His cottage at 67 Otitori Bay
Road has been restored and hosts guided visits. An additional house
has also been built for visiting artists in residence.</p>

<p>Kauri were a major inspiration to McCahon in this period. Around
50 of his paintings have a link or focus on kauri. Today, the kauri
McCahon painted at his cottage are dying from kauri dieback
disease. These trees which should have stood for another thousand
years may now only survive in these paintings.</p>

<p>From protecting our national icon, the kiwi, to working on
ground-breaking new treatments in the fight against cancer, Maori
scientific innovation is at the forefront of the second series of
Project Matauranga, on Maori Television.</p>

<p>Presented by Victoria University lecturer Dr Ocean Mercier, the
13-part series is funded by Te Māngai Paho and sponsored by The
Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.</p>

<p>Project Matauranga&nbsp;highlights the growth of Maori
worldviews within New Zealand's scientific community and celebrates
the people and ideas that are giving our country an edge in the
world of science.</p>

<p>Formatted around the structure of an experiment, viewers see
problems resolved through the application of Western science and
Maori knowledge systems.</p>

<p>As Dr Mercier explains "Our brand of science maybe a little
different from Western science but nonetheless it allowed us to
work in the world, to be in the world, to live in the world, to
survive in the world for generations and thousands of years".</p>

<p>In Episode 10 of the second series, Project
Matauranga&nbsp;looks at the steps being taken to address the
spread of&nbsp;kauri dieback&nbsp;disease that could decimate the
iconic forests of the North and push kauri, the giant of the
ngahere, to the brink of extinction.Click <a

              <data alias="IntroText"><![CDATA[In July the programme partners commissioned Independent Quality Assurance New Zealand (IQANZ) to conduct an independent review of the kauri dieback programme with the assistance of a generous grant from the Tindall Foundation.  The purpose of the review was to provide a credible, independent view of the progress the Kauri Dieback Programme and to recommend opportunities for improvement and a suggested direction for the future.  IQANZ have produced two reports; a high-level summary of findings and recommendations and a more in-depth report.

<h3>Programme Leadership Team response to independent
review:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The Kauri Dieback Programme Leadership Team welcomes the views
expressed by independent review of the programme.</p>

<p>It is pleasing to receive independent confirmation of the steady
progress of the programme.&nbsp; The report acknowledges the effort
put into getting the programme up and running and concludes that we
have established a good basis for the future.</p>

<p>The report is timely, given we are in the midst of the business
case for the future programme.&nbsp; We have factored many of the
recommendations into our analysis, notably:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leading, not managing</li>

<li>Planning better, not running faster</li>

<li>Improving practice and stretching performance</li>

<li>Investing in a wider range of research -over a longer
horizon</li>

<li>Allocating realistic resource levels</li>
</ul>

<p>Other recommendations will be acted on once we've confirmed
arrangements and funding for the new phase of the programme.</p>

<p>We thank Peter O'Connor of IQANZ for his professional and
thorough approach to this work and the Tindall Foundation for their
generous grant to fund Peter's work.</p>

documentary is now available to view online - just click <a

Following the film, the group discussed ways to
improve&nbsp;awareness of the kauri dieback issue and increase
community involvement. Some great ideas were brought up including
suggestions on ways to improve management on parks and our
awareness campaigns.</p>

<p>There&nbsp;are opportunities for members of the public to help
with the maintenance of boot cleaning stations on parks, join a
team of advocates to help 'spread the word' and improve compliance
at the cleaning stations. Last night, there was also support for
the&nbsp; formation of a 'friends of kauri' group. Watch this space
for more updates.</p>

<p>Auckland Council recently completed a 'People's Panel' survey to
measure awareness and attitudes&nbsp;on kauri dieback and it's
management.<br />
A stunning 3077 people responded to this survey
and&nbsp;<span><span>82% of participants were aware of kauri
dieback disease.</span></span> <span>Three quarters (74%) of those
who knew of kauri dieback also recognised that the disease
is</span> spread by soil. Read the full report <a
href="/{localLink:2246}" target="_blank"
title="People's Panel Survey Nov 2013 (560 KB PDF)">here</a>.</p>

<p>It looks like awareness of kauri dieback is growing - these
are&nbsp;our best results to date! Thanks to everyone that has
helped spread the word about this issue!&nbsp;Let's keep this
momentum going&nbsp;and keep&nbsp;this issue on people's minds.
With moderate compliance at our cleaning&nbsp;stations on park, we
need to keep raising these levels of awareness.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Please continue to spread the word and
help us keep kauri standing.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks to everyone that participated
in the survey.These results have been used to provide a measure of
current knowledge of kauri dieback, in order to assess the
effectiveness of the kauri dieback communications programme in
Auckland over time. The wealth of information will also inform our
management on parks and help shape an awareness campaign for this
summer.</p>

<p>Following the welcome and blessing by Ngati Whatua o Orakei
representatives, the event was formally opened by Dr Paul Hutchison
MP for Hunua who set the tone for the day by saying, "The Minister
of Primary Industries, Hon Nathan Guy, is eagerly anticipating
receiving the business case for the next 10 year programme very
soon.&nbsp; I am sure that, provided that the business case is
robust and defendable, that the government will play its part in
assisting councils and the Department of Conservation in funding
and implementing another successful Joint Agency long term kauri
dieback management programme."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was a full day with thirteen speakers each sharing their
unique angle on the disease issue. &nbsp;Session one speakers gave
an introduction to the issue, with the following three sessions
covering: What's happening now?; Where to from here?; And,
Spreading the word.&nbsp; Each session was followed by an excellent
question and answer time that could only be wrapped up by the lure
of food and drink.</p>

<p>Having representatives from the scientific community, tangata
whenua, community groups and the general public made for
interesting and informative discussions both in the lecture theatre
and informally during the breaks, and although we can often
perceive insurmountable odds against this disease, a feeling of
positivity and momentum was created during the event. The following
day approximately 20 people joined experts on a field trip to
Albany Scenic Reserve, one of Aucklands worst hit kauri dieback
sites.&nbsp;Feedback from both days has been very positive, with
participants and speakers already looking forward with anticipation
to next years event. Roll on Symposium 2014!</p>

<p>Widely recognised by many as a cultural taonga and icon of our
unique native flora, kauri trees and the exploitation of their
timber have been at the heart of the story of the development of
Aotearoa New Zealand.The kauri timber milling industry that
flourished from the mid 1800s to the early 1900s was a massive
economic driver for the burgeoning economy of a young nation, as
well as shaping the development of towns and cities across the
North Island.</p>

<p>This screening presented a selection of archival titles from The
Film Archive which chart the shifting relationship between people
and kauri over the last 100 years, followed by a new documentary
examining the latest threat to kauri, a microscopic soil-borne
organism causing the devastating Kauri Dieback Disease, and the
role we must all now play in caring for kauri.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The selection of archival films was well received and provided a
couple of moments of unintentional humour via the presenters of
Spot On and the language used by the Country Calendar presenter.
The "Save Our Kauri Forests" DVD provided the much needed update
for all on the current status and lead into some lively discussion.
Will Ngakuru also joined us and provided additional information
along with Nick. A suggestion was made to hold an outdoor "picnic"
screening somewhere close to a forest as a way of providing a focus
on the reality of the issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks to Paula Booker from the New Zealand Film Archive, Jon
Bywater from Elam for organising the venue and Nick Waipara from
Auckland&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biosecurity. Though small, this was a successful event.</p>

While phosphite may prove to be a useful tool to manage infected trees (and allow them to tolerate the disease for a time) it does not cure diseased kauri.
]]></data>
              <data alias="Image" />
              <data alias="bodyText"><![CDATA[
<p>Phosphite is a biodegradable fungicide that has been widely used
to manage&nbsp;other phytophthora species overseas and within the
horticultural industry. Over the last 3 years, scientists from
Plant &amp; Food have been working&nbsp; to determine if this tool
could also be used to manage kauri dieback here in New
Zealand.&nbsp;Preliminary results from field trials have been
promising, however we still have much more to learn.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
It should be noted that phosphite isn't the silver bullet we'd all
love&nbsp;to&nbsp;find -&nbsp;rather a&nbsp;tool that may
help&nbsp;with the management of diseased areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Phosphite works by weakening the pathogen and boosting the tree's
own natural defences. Application&nbsp;does not eliminate the
disease from the area&nbsp;and&nbsp;only&nbsp;allows the tree to
tolerate the disease for a short time period (yet to be
determined).<br />
At this stage there is no tool that will eradicate kauri
dieback.<br />
<br />
Our scientists are still working hard to find a cure and looking
for resistance in the natural population of kauri.</p>

<p>Tiffany Singh will create a major new work honouring our revered
kauri as the Temporary Artist Project at Brick Bay Sculpture Trail
in January.</p>

<p>Currently Artist in Residence at the McCahon House, Titirangi,
and recently returned from the Montalvo Arts Centre residency in
California, Singh's recent practice has formed an enquiry into
concepts of wellbeing. This latest installation calls attention to
the important issue of kauri dieback disease affecting New
Zealand's giants of the forest.</p>

<p>Titled '<em>The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the
eyes of others only a green thing that stands in the way'</em>
Singh draws on the ancient tradition of tree worship (dendrolatry)
in this piece, creating 'an offering to the forest spirits' to
protect the Kauri from this devastating disease. Visitors
experiencing the work will learn about and carry out the hygiene
necessary to halt the spread of the disease which is caused by a
microscopic soil-born pathogen.</p>

<p>Linking East and West, Singh's work will take the form of
Japanese Torii Gates, building on the Eastern connection
established when New Zealand's great Tāne Mahuta was partnered with
Jomon Sugi, a giant cedar on Yakushima Island in Japan, in
2009.</p>

<p>Torii gates are traditionally placed at the entrance to shrines,
significantly dividing our visible world and that of the spirit
world.&nbsp; At Brick Bay a series of these gates will lead people
through the Kauri grove to the main giant Kauri (over 100 years
old), which Singh views as living shrines. Visitors will be invited
to play the bells suspended above (fair trade, from India), which
become softer and of higher tone along the walk.</p>

<p>The pathway, and the gates of '<em>The tree which moves some to
tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing that
stands in the way'</em> culminate close to Phil Dadson's
'Listen-stop', an interactive art work described by Dadson as "a
prosthetic performance task for solo, contemplative listening
and/or conversation with the birds, the bells and the kauri".</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A special event every summer season, the Temporary Artist
Project serves to broaden an understanding of sculpture, in
addition to the diverse abundance of work by leading New Zealand
artists available for sale at Brick Bay Sculpture Trail.</p>

<p>The artist will give a talk on site at 1pm on Saturday 18
January 2014.</p>

              <data alias="IntroText"><![CDATA[Several media outlets have been running a story stating that the Kauri Dieback Management Programme has been extended for the next 5 – 10 years. To clarify, June 2014 will see the end of the first phase of the Programme and associated funding. While we are confident that the Programme will continue is some form, what that will look like and funding for the next phase is still to be determined.

Held in the atrium this event captures people’s interest as they enter and exit the museum, placing them in the role of scientist looking at a diverse range of topics from fossils to tarantula to kauri dieback.

<p>The kauri dieback programme was represented at the Auckland
Council Biosecurity table.&nbsp; A microscope showing kauri dieback
spores proved very fascinating to visitors young and old, many
could not believe that something so small could kill a tree so
large and majestic as the kauri.</p>

<p>A fact that caught many people's attention was that kauri
dieback spores can survive in the soil on your footwear for at
least five years, and that similar diseases around the world could
survive for 30 years plus!&nbsp; This helped to reinforce the
message of cleaning your footwear and equipment before and after
visiting kauri forests.</p>

<p>The publics awareness of kauri dieback seemed quite high with
the vast majority of people knowing about kauri dieback and the
need to have clean footwear entering and exiting kauri
forest.&nbsp; This may have been due to the recent discovery of
kauri dieback in the Coromandel, or the interests of people who
visit museums, but either way the word is getting out that we need
to act together to keep kauri standing.</p>

<p>This environmental education event was enjoyed by 1500 primary
and intermediate age children from south Auckland schools over
three days with a free community day on the following Saturday.</p>

<p>Auckland council biosecurity staff represented the Kauri Dieback
Management Programme, joining organisations such as the Zoo, the
Auckland Museum, Auckland Council biodiversity and the Monarch
Butterfly NZ Trust in educating young minds on environmental
matters.</p>

<p>The kauri dieback activity involved a 15m x 15m maze which
contained photos of plants and animals that are found in a kauri
forest, information about hygiene measures to stop the spread of
kauri dieback and a boot cleaning station. Each class was first
given a five minute talk about why kauri are special, what kauri
dieback is and how we can all help protect kauri. After this they
were given a simple question sheet and sent into the maze to
collect the answers.</p>

<p><span>Image: Olivia Baber</span></p>

<p>Often three classes turned up at the maze at the same time,
which made for a very busy and hectic three days!</p>

<p>All the students seemed to enjoy the maze (what child doesn't
like running around a maze on a school day) and left knowing more
about kauri and kauri dieback.</p>

<p>Thanks goes out to the amazing volunteers who helped out on the
school days to make the kauri dieback maze a success!</p>

kauri dieback symposium last year.&nbsp;It was a full day with
thirteen speakers each sharing their unique angle on the disease
issue. &nbsp;Session one speakers gave an introduction to the
issue, with the following three sessions covering: What's happening
now?; Where to from here?; And, Spreading the word.&nbsp;<br />

<p>The Kauri Project is an ongoing initiative to use art as a
language for raising awareness and promoting understanding of kauri
dieback disease and the scientific, cultural, social and economic
contexts that inform kauri's current situation.<br />
Co-curators Chris McBride and Ariane Craig-Smith are passionate
about raising awareness of environmental concerns,
particularly&nbsp;kauri dieback through art and are working
collaboratively with The Kauri Dieback Management Programme.</p>

<p>The first of the art projects to be developed by the Kauri
Project is the Poster Series. Contemporary artists and designers
Charlotte Graham, Philip Kelly, Tessa Laird, Natalie Robertson and
Haruhiko Sameshima have been commissioned to produced new works
addressing the social, cultural and historical value of the kauri
tree, one of our most beloved species, in the face of the threat
posed by kauri dieback disease. These beautiful posters can be seen
at the Lopdell House Gallery until the 9th of June.<br />

<div class="WordSection1">
<p><span><span>Kauri dieback is caused by a microscopic fungus-like
organism called <em>Phytophthora</em> "taxon Agathis" (PTA) which
spreads through soil movement, for example on footwear and
equipment such as machinery and mountain bikes.</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>Kauri dieback was formally identified in New Zealand
in 2008 and has since been found in Auckland, Northland, Great
Barrier Island and in the Whangapoua Forest/Hukarahi Conservation
Area in Coromandel, which was closed to the public on 25 March as a
precaution.</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Since 2009, the Ministry for Primary Industries and
Department of Conservation have partnered with Tāngata whenua,
Northland Regional Council, Auckland Council, Waikato Regional
Council and Bay of Plenty Regional Council to slow the spread of
kauri dieback and identify better ways to detect, manage and
control the disease.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>"Several rounds of aerial surveillance have now been
completed across the Coromandel Peninsula to look for any notable
stands of kauri which may look sick or dead," says Kauri Dieback
Programme relationship manager Ian Mitchell.</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>"Any suspect stands are followed up with soil
sampling, which has taken place in the Whangapoua Forest/Hukarahi
Conservation Area; at the northern end of the Whangapoua Forest;
and at various sites across the Peninsula. We expect to be able to
report on lab results by the end of May.</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>"We are also updating kauri dieback signage and increasing
the number of cleaning stations at key sites on the Peninsula.
Permanent cleaning stations are being installed at Waiumu kauri
grove, the Pinnacles track, Wainora/Cookson's kauri walk,
Whenuakite, and Waiau kauri grove on the 309 Road."</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Ian says everyone is being reminded to do their bit to
prevent the spread of kauri dieback by making sure they clean
footwear, vehicle tyres and machinery when moving to or from any
kauri forests.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>"The support of our partners and the community is vital
for managing the spread of kauri dieback.</span></p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>"The Coromandel Kauri Dieback Forum is being established
with the support of government agencies to bring together community
groups and industry with an interest in slowing the spread of kauri
dieback on the Peninsula.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>"Our engagement with Tāngata whenua is crucial. All
Tāngata whenua groups across Coromandel and Hauraki are being
contacted and invited to be engaged in the response. Relationships
are being formed with those groups who have indicated interests in
or near the infected site.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>"Kauri is a taonga and incredibly important to New
Zealanders and all the programme partners are fully committed to
managing the spread of this disease," says Ian.</span></p>

kauri dieback using the school resource produced by the kauri
dieback management programme.</p>

<p>Named <span>Whakaruruhau o te Kura</span> Which means 'Protector
of the School'. &nbsp;The kauri was planted in the garden that
borders the road and drop off area. Students will be able to watch
it grow for many years after they have left the school.</p>

Our iconic kauri and kauri ecosystems are under threat from a
fungus-like organism which is causing 'kauri dieback'.</p>

<p>The Kauri Dieback Management Programme was formed in 2009 to
combat the disease and is a partnership between the Ministry for
Primary Industries, the Department of Conservation, Northland
Regional Council, Auckland Council, Waikato Regional Council, Bay
of Plenty Regional Council, and tāngata whenua from areas with
naturally occurring kauri.</p>

<p>The programme partners are working collaboratively to reduce the
spread and impacts of the disease. Key programme activities include
public engagement and awareness raising, surveillance, and
management of forest tracks and hygiene facilities.&nbsp; The
programme also has a significant research component which aims to
develop effective management tools and to improve our understanding
of the fundamentals of the disease.</p>

<p>This forum has been established to enable locals to take action
in their own communities to combat kauri dieback disease and foster
the health of kauri throughout the Coromandel Peninsula.</p>

<p>Local organisations and concerned individuals are being invited
to join the forum and work out practical ways to protect kauri in
their own communities, complementing the reach and resources of the
national Kauri Dieback Management Programme.</p>

<p>Interim forum chair Vivienne McLean said forum meetings will be
held to share knowledge and resources and keep everyone up to date
with the latest research and strategies coming out of the national
programme.</p>

<p>"The disease is here, and there is no known cure, but if we act
now and work together we can limit its spread. Community-based
effort will be the key to protecting our kauri," she said. "We are
hoping to get a wide cross-section attending, in particular iwi,
tourism operators and accommodation providers, tramping clubs,
hunters, farmers, schools, Scouts, service clubs, nurseries, pest
and weed control contractors, multi-sports event organisers.
Everyone has a part to play in protecting our kauri."</p>

<p>The inaugural meetings are open to anyone with an interest in
protecting Coromandel kauri. Each meeting will include an update on
the situation on the Coromandel Peninsula, national initiatives and
the latest research into this deadly disease, as well as workshops
where people will identify what is needed to protect their local
kauri and who can help in their community.</p>

<p>The Whitianga meeting will be held on Sunday 31 August in the
Whitianga Town Hall from 2:00pm to 5:00pm.</p>

<p>Anyone interested in attending please RSVP to Kauri 2000 by
Thursday 28 August&nbsp; - phone 07 866 0468 or email

<p>Check out this great opportunity working with scientists from
Plant &amp; Food Research "Identifying Killers of Kauri and other
Trees"</p>

<p>The main aim of this project is to rejuvenate, identify,
condense and store <em>Phytophthora</em> cultures of interest. Once
rejuvenated and growing well on agar plates, cultures will be
sorted into groups based on their morphology and representative
samples will be identified by DNA sequencing. Significant cultures
will then be placed back into long-term-storage. There may also be
an opportunity (dependant on timing and other work) to set up/look
into a DNA fingerprinting assay for our lab to use routinely to
identify unknown <em>Phytophthora</em> cultures.</p>

<p><strong>Duties</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Rejuvenate, maintain (subculture) and store Phytophthora
cultures from our collection.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Prepare samples for DNA sequencing using PCR and gel
electrophoresis.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Run BLAST searches to identify/confirm a culture from its DNA
sequence.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Load updated collection information into a computer based
register.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span>The Programme shared the results
with people who attended the inaugural meetings of the Coromandel
Kauri Dieback Forum held in Whangamata, Thames and Whitianga over
the weekend. You can read more about this new group of people who
are committed to preventing the spread of kauri dieback
below.</span></p>

<p><strong>The results</strong></p>

<p>The disease has been confirmed at only two sites on the
Coromandel. The first site was where kauri dieback disease was
first detected in March 2014 at the Whangapoua Forest/Hukarahi
Conservation Area, which is administered by the Department of
Conservation (DOC). The second site is on private land to the north
of the Whangapoua settlement. The programme has a policy of not
publically releasing the details of infected private property
without the consent of the landowners.</p>

<p>The scale of the surveillance carried out was one of the largest
the Kauri Dieback Programme has coordinated to date. On behalf of
the Programme I would like to thank the mana whenua, the Kauri 2000
Trust, land owners and community groups for their support and
assistance. They have been keen to learn about how they could help
prevent the spread of the disease, as well as provide valuable
information about their land, and access to it when required.</p>

<p><strong>What we learnt from the surveillance</strong></p>

<p>The infected area in the Whangapoua Forest/Hukarahi Conservation
Area was closed to the public to reduce the risk of spreading the
disease on 25 March. On the same day we began intensive aerial and
ground surveillance, including soil sampling, across the whole
Peninsula and the northern Kaimai Ranges.</p>

<p>Mana whenua also joined agency staff as they carried out the
soil sampling process, so they could increase their skills in
carrying out soil sampling and related monitoring.</p>

<p>The results of this intensive surveillance indicate that kauri
dieback is not widespread and appears to be limited to a relatively
small area in the northern half of the Peninsula.</p>

<p>Testing at the Whangapoua Forest/Hukarahi Conservation Area
indicates that the disease is not widespread at this site. However,
the new site has a more widespread and advanced infection.</p>

<p>Tracing work, interviews with land managers and the pattern of
disease symptoms indicate that PTA has been at these sites for
decades. The common link between the two infected forests is
adjacency to the former New Zealand Forest Service (NZFS) managed
Whangapoua State Forest (constituted primarily of radiata pine),
which was largely established in the 1970s and 1980s, but also
included trial plantings in the late 1940s.</p>

<p>Historic NZFS activity has also been implicated in the spread of
kauri dieback to other infected sites in Northland and
Auckland.</p>

<p><strong>How the affected sites will be managed</strong></p>

<p>Following on from the surveillance, the Programme carried out a
full risk assessment of each of the two sites, and from this
developed a long term plan for how best to manage each area.</p>

<p>As there are no walking tracks and limited access to the
Whangapoua Forest/Hukarahi Conservation Area, this increases the
chances of containing the disease. This area will remain closed
while we continue talking with the local community, mana whenua and
adjoining landowners on how the site will be managed over the long
term.</p>

<p>We now have a draft management plan for the newly identified
site and priority actions are to keep cattle out of the forest,
control pigs and restrict peoples' access. The primary land manager
has already agreed to restrict access and signage will be installed
in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>Management across the Peninsula</strong></p>

<p>Kauri dieback signage has been installed on all tracks
administered by DOC, plus new hygiene stations have been placed on
tracks that are used heavily. Ad hoc surveillance will continue to
be carried out in response to observations of suspicious symptoms.
This is the same process that led to the identification of the
infection in the Whangapoua Forest/Hukarahi Conservation Area.</p>

<p>The Programme is continuing to work with tangata whenua across
the Coromandel to develop initiatives including marae-based hui,
community engagement and education activities.</p>

<p>The Programme was excited when the Kauri 2000 Trust told us of
their plans to set up a new Coromandel Kauri Dieback Community
Forum to develop a strategy for kauri protection across the
Coromandel. We are keen to work alongside this group to continue
increasing our relationship with the local communities on
preventing kauri dieback.</p>

<p>The Trust's efforts to prevent the spread of kauri dieback will
also be supported by a grant of $57,000 recently announced by
Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner. The grant comes from
the Department of Conservation's Community Conservation Partnership
Fund.</p>

<p>As you know, without any treatment or control tools, the only
way we can protect our kauri forests is prevent kauri dieback
spreading - which requires everyone to get involved. The way the
people of Coromandel have gathered together to help to this is a
great example, which we'd like to see mirrored right across all
regions with naturally-occurring kauri.</p>

<p>If you know of family, friends or visitors from overseas who are
planning to visit any kauri forest, remind them to:</p>

<p> make sure their shoes, tyres and equipment are cleaned to
remove all visible soil and plant material before AND after
visiting kauri forest</p>

<p> use cleaning stations where provided: scrub to remove all soil
and spray with water or disinfectant.</p>

<p> stay on the track and off kauri roots</p>

<p> keep your dog on a leash at all times.</p>

<p>Kauri dieback is a fungus-like disease that is specific to kauri
and kills trees of all ages and sizes. &nbsp;It is spread mainly
through soil movement on equipment such as footwear, machinery and
mountain bikes. Scientists are working hard but there is no known
cure at this time - nearly every infected tree eventually dies. The
only way we can save our kauri is to contain the disease where it
is and stop the spread into healthy areas. Kauri dieback is killing
our kauri forests in the Waitakere Ranges area, however there are
still many areas that remain uninfected at this stage. We need your
help to stop the spread of the disease and to protect kauri that
are still healthy. Join the team to empower communities and raise
awareness of kauri dieback so we can keep kauri standing in the
west for future generations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The "Kauri Dieback Community Co-ordinator - Waitakere" contract
involves 30 hour of work/week and is offered until June 2015 with
the possibility of extension for a further three years. &nbsp;<a

<p>Alastair Jamieson (Wild Earth Media) has worked with Auckland
Council and the Kauri Dieback Management Programme since 2010 to
help identify areas of kauri dieback disease unable to be seen from
standard ground surveillance (ie. off tracks/mid bush). This work
has involved getting up in a helicopter to take high resolution
geo-tagged photographs of kauri that appeared ill from the air
within the Waitakere Ranges, Hunua Ranges and Hauraki Gulf
Islands.</p>

<p>Alastair worked with Auckland Council and Plant &amp; Food

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Location:</strong> Auckland or
Whangarei</p>

<p>New Zealand's iconic kauri are dying from a fungus-like
organism, called kauri dieback disease. Although research is
continuing, there is no cure. The only way to keep kauri standing
is working with forest users, tangata whenua, communities,
landowners, industry and scientists.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The passionate and busy team leading this work is the Kauri
Dieback Programme. This is a partnership programme involving people
from the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Department of
Conservation, Northland Regional Council, Auckland Council, Waikato
Regional Council, Bay of Plenty Regional Council, and tāngata
whenua from areas with naturally occurring kauri.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Programme is expanding its activities under a ten year plan,
which is being supported by additional funding for research and
public tracks.&nbsp; Part of this growth includes four new exciting
and challenging roles to lead the key activities needed to keep
kauri standing protecting kauri.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<strong>14/501 Operations Lead</strong></a></p>

<p>You will be the central point for improving and aligning the
operational activities across different regions and land
tenure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your key focus will be on driving collaboration for operational
planning through the Programme by ensuring resources are used
efficiently and effectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is your opportunity for developing effective engagement and
communication strategies, as well as providing a coherent and
consistent public presence for the Programme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To be successful in this role you will need to use your ability
to identify the resources required including people and skill sets,
supplies and associated budgets, and oversee coordination of
engagement and communications in regions, as well as maintaining
communication with the team.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a

<strong>14/488 Planning &amp; Intelligence Lead</strong></a></p>

<p>You will be responsible for the leadership, coordination and
management of knowledge (science and mātauranga Māori based) in the
Programme.&nbsp; The role also assists major planning processes as
well as performance measurement and continual improvement. The
Planning and Intelligence Team Lead will be an important driving
force for ensuring the Programme gains critical knowledge and has a
focus on continual improvement and adaptive management.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each of three above roles will require excellent negotiating and
communication skills which are essential as you will be overseeing
a virtual team of partner agency staff and tāngata whenua
representatives.</p>

regional level. In this role, you will assist in the development of
effective engagement and communications strategies, and provide a
coherent and consistent public voice for the Programme.</p>

<p>Thanks to the combined efforts of people, communities and the
Programme partners, we have achieved a great deal over the last
five years. This strategy builds on our current work, and increases
focus on the areas we believe will have the greatest impact. In
developing and agreeing this strategy the Programme will deliver
increased activities or improvements to:</p>

<ul>
<li>the&nbsp; work that is carried out on the ground</li>

<li>how we gain and use knowledge about the disease</li>

<li>how we work with, and support people and communities to help
manage the disease</li>

<li>the way the Programme operates.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By focusing on the areas listed above we aim to ensure healthy
kauri forests continue to be an iconic part of New Zealand's
landscape that future generations are able to enjoy.</p>

]]></data>
              <data alias="Image" />
              <data alias="bodyText"><![CDATA[
<p><span>The appointment follows last year's Forum workshops in
which local communities around the Peninsula worked together to
identify ways to limit the impact of kauri dieback disease
(<em>Phytophthora Taxon&nbsp;Agathis</em>).</span></p>

<p><span>Alison will help set up, support and co-ordinate
community-led programmes to contain the spread of kauri dieback
disease in the Coromandel area.</span></p>

<p><span>"We are extremely grateful to the Department of
Conservation for the funding which has made this possible," says
interim Forum chair Vivienne McLean. "We are confident that
Alison's communications expertise and experience in working with
community groups, plus her energy and creative thinking, will
enable the Forum to make significant progress from now on. Setting
up and supporting local groups will be a top priority, and over the
next six months she will be establishing contact and working with
schools, developing closer relationships with local iwi and helping
us organise our next forum, among other work."</span></p>

<p><span>Kauri dieback disease was first confirmed on the Peninsula
last March in the Hukarahi Reserve near Whitianga, and infected
sites have since been identified in the Whangapoua catchment. Sites
reported by locals in other parts of the Peninsula are currently
being investigated.</span></p>

<p><span>The Forum, an independent volunteer organisation working
alongside the Kauri Dieback Management Programme, Department of
Conservation, and the Thames Coromandel District and Waikato
Regional Councils, believes it will take a combination of
individual effort and a collective rallying of communities to stop
further loss of this iconic species.</span></p>

<p><span>"It could be seen as a very daunting task - given what our
kauri face - but local communities are proving to be very
passionate about protecting their kauri and the Forum is just one
component in growing network of individuals, organisations and
agencies committed to working together to save this iconic
species," says Alison.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;<span>"In my previous roles with TCDC and Waikato Regional
Council I've learned how very lucky we are on the Coromandel to
have our networks of residents who generously give their time and
energy to volunteering, so it is a real honour to be in this
role."</span></p>

<p><span>"We want to hear from anyone who would like to help,
whether with ideas or practical actions out in the bush. Every
individual can play a vital role in protecting kauri, at work and
at play, by helping to spread the word and by observing the proper
hygiene procedures."</span></p>

<p><span>"The message is actually pretty simple. Kauri dieback
disease is spread through soil movement, so cleanliness is the key,
whether you're tramping, mountain biking, hunting, undertaking pest
control, fencing or property development. Scrub your boots, walking
poles and any equipment or machinery completely free of soil before
and after going into the bush, every time. If you would like to get
more involved, contact me about becoming a kauri champion and be
part of the great group of people that make up the Coromandel Kauri
Dieback Forum," says Alison.</span></p>

<p><span>Kauri dieback disease kills kauri of all sizes and ages,
and there is currently no known cure. New Zealand has only around 1
percent of its kauri remaining, which makes efforts to reduce the
threat from the microscopic <em>Phytophthora taxon Agathis</em> (or
PTA ) disease even more urgent.</span></p>

<p><span>Kauri Dieback Management Programme Relationship Manager
Ian Mitchell says the support of both the kauri dieback programme
partners and the community is vital for managing&nbsp;kauri dieback
spread.</span></p>

<p><span>"Kauri is a taonga and incredibly important to New
Zealanders and all the programme partners are fully committed to
managing the spread of this disease," says Ian. He says engagement
with tangata whenua is also crucial. All tāngata whenua groups
across Coromandel and Hauraki are being approached to become active
partners in the Forum.</span></p>

<p><span>Anyone wishing to help establish a local group committed
to fighting kauri dieback disease in their area should contact
Alison Smith on 07 864 7553.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Okura Bush Walkway is one of Auckland's most popular
walkways for a reason - the track winds its way next to the
stunning Okura River estuary through beautiful mixed groves of
pohutukawa, nikau and kauri to the coast. This environment has
inspired a growing and highly passionate community based group, the
Friends of Okura Bush, intent on restoring the native biodiversity
of the Okura Bush. With a small army of willing, enthusiastic
volunteers, they work tirelessly to reduce the animal pests and
invasive weeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The Friends of Okura Bush organised the Okura Forest
Festival on the 14<sup>th</sup> February to pull together community
groups and local music talent to celebrate the forest, raise
awareness of local environmental issues and raise funds to support
forest restoration work.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>So what better way to spend Valentine's than by
participating in a gorgeous forest festival in appreciation of this
beautiful forest?&nbsp; Auckland Council Biosecurity Advisor Zoe
Lyle, attended this lovely forest fundraiser to raise awareness of
kauri dieback.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Friends of Okura Bush are strong advocates for the
protection of kauri from kauri dieback disease.&nbsp; Unfortunately
kauri dieback disease is alarmingly real in Okura bush with one
area of kauri currently succumbing to this fatal
disease.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The kauri dieback stand presented a forest activity
to encourage children to create their own beautiful creatures to
add to the forest whilst learning how to stop the spread of kauri
dieback.&nbsp; When visiting Okura bush please ensure that all
footwear is cleaned before and after your visit and remember to
stay on the tracks!</span></span></p>

Approximately 70 of those attendees also went on a field trip

there were community groups who work to protect or conserve kauri;
tourism operators who take visitors through native areas and the
various teams within the Kauri Dieback Management Programme.</p>

<p>One person said 'It was an incredible privilege to be there
surrounded by so many people committed to understanding the issues
around kauri dieback and working towards solutions. I have
certainly left with a completely new level of understanding and
awareness of the different perspectives….it was invaluable!'</p>

<p>Another theme was the need for everyone involved in protecting
kauri to continue working together to share our knowledge,
resources, and engaging people in removing soil and cleaning their
gear before and after visiting kauri forests.</p>

<p>Many attendees also commented on the range of activities
underway across kauri land and the diversity of people committed to
protecting kauri.</p>

<p>Film clips of the presentations from day one will be available
on this website&nbsp;in early March, and the media interviews are
available on the Programme's facebook page: <a

<p>The Symposium Organising Committee (made up of <a
href="http://www.kauridieback.co.nz/working-together">the Kauri
Dieback Programme partners</a>, SCION, Plant and Food Research,
Landcare and Bio Protection) are currently surveying attendees for
feedback on this year's Symposium, and how we can improve future
ones. So thank you to everyone who made this year's Symposium a
success and we look forward to hosting the next annual event.</p>

              <data alias="Image" />
              <data alias="bodyText"><![CDATA[
<p>The workshop was suggested by Martin Herbert, with support from
Treescape Environmental (TE) staff Jon Redfern and Erika Commers,
and covered kauri dieback symptoms, &nbsp;safe operating procedures
and hygiene requirements to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

<p>The key objective was to educate arborists about working with
kauri trees and kauri dieback in the Auckland region.We were
fortunate to have two excellent speakers Dr Zoe Lyle and Dr Nick
Waipara from the council biosecurity team who were able to show the
oospores under the microscope.These spores are the main cause of
disease spread via soil movement.</p>

<p>Martin Herbert summarised the advise from the workshop in
Treescapes latest newsletter:<br />
 "It's important arborists do not work around kauri when the soil
is wet and follow cleaning procedures whenever working near these
trees. Hygiene procedures require the removal of soil followed by
treatment with Trigene (broad spectrum disinfectant which is
non-toxic). This can be applied with a hand held spray applicator,
or using knapsack sprayers in larger areas. All Treescape staff
need to make themselves familiar with kauri work and the Treescape
developed environment safe operating procedure".</p>

<p>Like many other industries working around kauri, arboriculture
does pose a risk of spreading kauri dieback disease through
movement of soil and vegetation. It was great to see such a great
turn out to this workshop and passion to 'do the right thing' from
so many arborists! Another great story of how we can all work
together to 'keep kauri standing'.</p>

today.</p>

<p>"Highlighting the value of our kauri forests and the threat
posed by dieback to these forest giants among all our community -
and all visitors to our nation ­- is a vital part of the work of
the Kauri Dieback Programme," Ms Barry says.</p>

<p>"Chinese New Zealanders, and the increasing numbers of tourists
from China, enjoy visiting kauri forests as much as anyone, so it's
important that we ensure they know about the disease and how to
prevent its spread."</p>

<p>Visitors to kauri forests such as those around Arataki can
unwittingly spread the spores which cause the deadly disease on
dirty footwear and equipment.</p>

<p>"We can only stop the spread of kauri dieback if everyone -
government, communities and individuals - works together and takes
responsibility."</p>

<p>Estella Lee, chairperson of the Chinese Conservation Education
Trust, says the $20,000 grant will allow the trust to expand its
awareness work.</p>

<p>"Through this grant, we will be able to get our kauri
conservation messages to far more Chinese people," Ms Lee says.</p>

<p>Some of the money will be used to lead tours to kauri forests to
highlight the disease and explain cleaning practices. The trust
will also run competitions and community events to promote kauri
dieback awareness.</p>

<p>This is the first community engagement project to be made
possible by the generous $480,000 donation to the Kauri Dieback
Programme from The Tindall and Aotearoa Foundations announced in
June.</p>

<p>"All New Zealanders will benefit if important kauri are
protected and the spread of this deadly disease is reduced," Ms
Barry says.</p>

<p>DOC is investing more than $21.6 million to upgrade tracks
through kauri forests, including the installation of 300 cleaning
stations, where walkers can ensure their footwear is
disinfected.</p>

<p>Almost ninety per cent of all those surveyed by Colmar Brunton
agreed that it is "important" or "very important" to manage kauri
dieback, even given the other threats to kauri forests.</p>

<p>The survey also found that 43 per cent of forest users are
committed enough to stopping kauri dieback to have asked others to
take action to prevent its spread.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sixty seven per cent of residents were found to be aware of
kauri dieback, as opposed to just 31 per cent in 2011.</p>

<p>However ten per cent of those who said they had not been near
kauri in the previous year proved to have been mistaken.</p>

<p>"That is a worry because kauri are common in native forests in
the upper North Island," says Jay Harkness, Engagement and
Communications Lead for the Kauri Dieback Programme.</p>

<p>"So the basic message is that if you're in the upper North
Island, and you're in native bush, you clean your footwear and
other gear before going into a forest and before leaving it, every
single time. People also need to use tracks, and stick to them.</p>

<p>"What's also of concern is the way in which people think kauri
dieback is spread. For instance, 19 per cent of the forest users
surveyed thought that dieback is spread on the wind. That's just
not true," Jay Harkness says.</p>

<p>"While it is true that kauri dieback can be spread by less than
a pinhead of soil, it's humans that are the number one way in which
the disease is spread.</p>

<p>"The good news is that kauri dieback is within everyone's
ability to control, that people are talking about dieback in their
networks, and that people are serious about preventing the spread
of the disease," Jay Harkness says. "Because kauri are a
cornerstone species, whole forests are dependent on our communities
getting involved in the issue - which they are doing on a large
scale."</p>

<p>A kauri tree shows no signs of infection until its canopy starts
to die, and often when bleeding lesions appear on its trunk.
Research indicates that most if not all infected trees eventually
die of the disease. There is no cure for kauri dieback.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fungus-like pathogen that causes kauri dieback has
been renamed.</p>

<p>It is now officially known as Phytophthora agathidicida (all
italics). The pathogen used to be known as Phytophthora taxon
Agathis, or PTA, a taxonomic name that was temporarily assigned to
the pathogen when it was first identified in 2008.</p>

<p>The Kids for Kauri (KfK) programme is a concept developed by <a
href="http://www.communitywaitakere.org.nz/"
target="_blank">Community Waitakere Charitable Trust</a>. It aims
to get kids and their families involved in a practical conservation
project to grow kauri in schools in the Auckland region. It is an
opportunity for communities to take action against kauri
dieback.</p>

<p>A pilot of the KfK programme to took place in four schools from
June - September 2012.</p>

<p>Each school had between 22 and 71 students who participated in
the in-depth education sessions which included:</p>

<p> The history of kauri</p>

<p> How we can protect kauri from kauri dieback disease</p>

<p> How to grow kauri and care for them</p>

<p> What do kauri mean to us in our everyday lives?</p>

<p> An evaluation of the session</p>

<p><img src="~/media/31887/key stats_500x293.jpg"  width="500"  height="293" alt="KfK key stats"/><br />
<br />
</p>

<p>Community Waitakere recommends a roll-out of a larger-scale KfK
programme in primary and intermediate schools in Auckland in the
near future. The initial focus would be on the schools in West
Auckland due to our geographic location and connection to the
Waitakere communities. The number of schools to participate per
year would depend on funding.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Kauri dieback spores can be
removed from footwear and equipment simply by scrubbing them with
warm water to remove all soil then allowing gear to dry. While not
essential, using Trigene will increase the effectiveness of these
hygiene measures.</span></p>

<p>We recommend using Trigene Advance disinfectant on footwear,
equipment, machinery and other items that have been in contact with
soil.</p>

<p>All gear should first be cleaned to remove soil. Trigene should
then be sprayed onto the clean surfaces (and left to dry). Trigene
will not kill kauri dieback spores that are embedded in soil.</p>

<p>Trigene is a broad spectrum disinfectant which is non-toxic,
non-corrosive, biodegradable and environmentally friendly.
Phytosanitary kits containing Trigene disinfectant are used by all
agencies involved in the Kauri Dieback Management Programme.</p>

<p>Trigene solution is effective for up to 12 months, however the
approved shelf life is six months. A fresh solution of Trigene
should be obtained every six months. Trigene concentrate has a
three- year shelf life. Expired Trigene can be returned to DOC or
your regional council for disposal or simply used as a general
detergent solution e.g. for general car cleaning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This solution is supplied at cleaning stations for visitors to
some parks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trigene is the preferred disinfectant as it causes minimal
adverse environmental impacts. Alternatively, household bleach and
water can be used to sterilise shoes and equipment before and after
walking through kauri areas.</p>

<p><strong>Ko te kauri he whakaruruhau mō te Iwi katoa</strong></p>

<p><strong>Kia toi tū he whenua</strong></p>

<p><strong>Kia toi tū he kauri<br />
<br />
</strong></p>

<p><em>The kauri is a shelter for all peoples</em></p>

<p><em>So that the land is sustained</em></p>

<p><em>So that the kauri stands proud</em></p>

<p><br />
In 2009, The Kauri Dieback Joint Agency Response Programme ('The
Programme') facilitated seven initial hui with tāngata whenua in
the kauri rohe which is inclusive of Kawhia to the west, across to
Tauranga Moana and Hauraki in the East, up to and including the
West and East coasts of Te Tai Tokerau.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hui sought the views on how to engage with tāngata whenua in
the response while taking into account practical issues around
resourcing.&nbsp; The hui [report][i] identified that Māori wanted
to be involved at all levels of the engagement.</p>

<p>In 2010, The Programme called for tāngata whenua who hold mana
whenua interests over whenua where kauri exists, to indicate their
interest in being involved in a strategic roopū which would work
with The Programme partners, to prevent the spread of PTA and
ensure the longevity of kauri.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The purpose of the Tāngata Whenua Roopū (TWR) is to provide
strategic advice into all aspects of the long term management plan
focusing on:</p>

<p>
■&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
preventing the spread of <em>Phytophthora taxon Agathis (PTA -
Kauri Dieback),&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>
■&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
addressing the impact of PTA on tāngata whenua and their
communities&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both [The Programme Charter]<a href="/#_edn2">[ii]</a> and the
&nbsp;[TWR Terms of Reference][iii] inform the parameters of the
involvement of tāngata whenua in The Programme.&nbsp; Marae, hapū,
iwi, or Māori land blocks within the kauri catchment can appoint a
representative to the programme by filling out an <a
href="/media/11554/reoi for twr for kauri dieback management_3.pdf">
[Expression of Interest]</a><sup>viii</sup></p>

<p>The TWR works to ensure that The Programme incorporates
mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge and knowledge systems) in the
response, and includes opportunities for tāngata whenua to build
capacity to undertake surveillance, monitoring, managing and
appropriately treating the disease and preventing the spread of the
disease.</p>

<p>The TWR has completed a number of projects, which have
contributed to the long term management of preventing the spread of
PTA.</p>

<p>Early this year The Kauri Dieback Programme and the TWR convened
a Kāhui Kaumātua hui to provide kaumātua with an update of progress
regarding the long term response.&nbsp; Kaumātua will be meeting in
early 2012 to discuss and advise how they consider they may best
inform the development of the Kauri Dieback response and to ensure
effective and consistent information across kauri rohe can be
communicated to whanau, hapū, iwi and their communities.</p>

<p>The next Kāhui Kaumātua hui will also explore mātauranga and its
application, and check that the response is consistent with [The
Kauri Dieback Programme Charter][vii].</p>

<h3>Planning earthworks?</h3>

<p>Care should be taken if working around kauri. To&nbsp;prevent
the introduction of kauri dieback, make sure <span>all machinery is
clean</span> before it enters your property.</p>

<p>All footwear, tools and equipment should also be cleaned of all
soil before and after working in kauri areas.</p>

<p>Where possbile, machinery and vehicles should remain on site for
the duration of a job.</p>
